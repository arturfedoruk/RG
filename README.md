# Notation
Throughout the programs theese notations can be found: 

- x1 := 5g'^2/48pi^2 = a1,
- x2 := g^2/16pi^2 = a2,
- x3 := gs^2/16pi^2 = a3,
- y1 := yt^2/16pi^2 = at,
- y2 := yb^2/16pi^2 = ab,
- z := lambda/16pi^2 = alambda,
- |L1,L2,L3|Ly1,Ly2|Lz| or L1L2L3Ly1Ly2Lz := loop orders for quantities above
- t := ln(mu^2/mu0^2), mu0 := 173.22 GeV
- dot := d/dt

# Running the programs
To run program ``X.cpp``, simply do

```
make X
./X
```
in your Linux terminal while being inside the directory, where X.cpp is

# ``smdr_pdg_2025.h``
File where *experimental* values of observables are stored

# ``loop_configs.cpp``
File, where the ``loop`` options for the functions inside ``Fit_Inputs()`` are stored for different loop configurations

# ``loop_Fit_Inputs.cpp``
``loop_Fit_Inputs()`` function declaration. Basically a ``SMDR_Fit_Inputs()``, 
but with ability of customizing loops, and also with some slight changes with energy scales of some calculations 
(namely, so that everything wat calculated of the energy scale ``Q==Q_in``)

# ``loop_Fit_Inputs_original.cpp``
The same as above, but without the change of energy-scale behavior from the ``SMDR_Fit_Inputs()``.

# ``init_random.cpp``
Recreates ROOT trees inside ``random_data.root`` for later filling them with random data generated by ``generate_random.cpp`` for loop configurations (111111,222222,333333,333221,444332,444333).
If the trees are already created, they'll vanish

# ``generate_random.cpp``
Asks for number of events *N*, and loop configuration *loops*, and then generates *N* normally-distributed (according to ``smdr_pdg_2025.h``) on-shells,
for each calculates ``loop_Fit_Inputs()``, and writes it into ``random_data.root`` into ``tree_loops``. Can be used multiple times for each tree.

# ``generate_net.cpp``
Asks for loop configuration *loops*, number of points along each axis *Npoints*, and number of sigmas for
each on-shell *a* in *{alpha_S, MZ, Mh, Mt, GF, mb(mb), Delta_alpha_had}*, and then generates a rectandular net inside the rectangle with
the center at the means of every on-shell, and the sides of 2*sigma_a* for every on-shell *a*, all according to ``smdr_pdg_2025.h``, calculates 
``loop_Fit_Inputs()`` for each point, and writes it into ``net_data.root`` into ``tree_loops``. ``net_data.root`` can then be used by ``fit.cpp``. 
One-liner way of running the program is
```
echo '333333 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5' | ./generate_net
```

# ``fit.cpp``
Asks, whether to use (*y/n*) default files (those be ``net_data.root`` & ``tree_222222_5,_:5_5_5_5_5_5_5``), if no, then asks for ROOT *file*, where
*fitting* and *assessing tree* are located, and *MSbar quantity* to fit. Then it uses ROOT minimizer to fit selected *MSbar quantity* with the designated
formula from the article using the data from *fitting tree*, then calculates the differences between fit and "real" data from *assessing tree*. The results
of fit are stored in ``fit_outputs/`` in designated ``.txt`` files: propogation of errors, fit errors, and fit results in the form of array, which then will be conveniemtly used in 
``wolfram/fit_tables.nb``. It was found convenient to use this program with ``fit_config.txt`` (example of such is provided) like this:
```
./fit < fit_config.txt
```

# ``theor_err.cpp``
This program calculates MSbar quantities on different energy scales from mu_0/2 to 2*mu_0 for different loop configurations (111111,222222,333333,333221,444332,444333).
This results are then runned to mu_0 in ``wolfram/parametric_N_theoretical.nb`` to calculate the theoreticl uncertainty. Generates ``output_theorerr.txt`` 
with the results of calculation, and ``forwolfram_theorerr.txt`` with the same results, but in a form, convenient for copypasting into ``wolfram/parametric_N_theoretical.nb``.

# Directories
- ``fit_outputs/`` - contains the results of fitting, produced by ``fit.cpp``
- ``legacy/`` - old programs and files, that were abandoned or replaced by programs discussed above
- ``net_datas/`` - collection of net datas used
- ``random_datas/`` - collection of random datas used, probably are not fully correct due to lack of updates and fixes, but soooorta resemble reality.
- ``wolfram/`` - Wolfram Mathematica notebooks that were also used, see README here
